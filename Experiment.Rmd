## Abstract

Monte Carlo model is a stochastic simulation method. It's a method of calculation based on the theoretical methods of probability and statistics. The central idea of it is to connect the problem with a certain probability model, and to realize statistical simulation or sampling by computer, so as to obtain the approximate solution of the problem.
We use the Monte Carlo model to estimate the approximation of the standard normal distribution.


## Math Equation

$$\hat{\Phi}({t})=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n {\mit I}({\mit X_i}\leq{ t})$$

where ${\mit X_i}$ 's are a random sample from ${\mit N}$(0,1), and ${\mit I}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function.
